I woke up in a smelling little bedroom, without windows. By the bed I was
laying in was a small table and to the north a glass door. On the floor was a
sports magazine.
There's a small table here. The small table contains:
  A wallet
  A reading lamp
  A bottle. The bottle contains:
    An amount of water
